In this exercise, we use the US Census dataset from the Census bureau (publicly available from UCI Machine Learning Repository). The task is to predict whether a given adult makes more than $50,000 a year or not based on a number of attributes.
The dataset has 14 column names as below:


• age: the age of an individual

• workclass: employment status of an individual

• fnlwgt: final weight. In other words, this is the number of people the census believes the entry 
represents

• education: the highest level of education achieved by an individual

• education-num: the highest level of education achieved in numerical form

• marital-status: marital status of an individual.

• occupation: the general type of occupation of an individual

• relationship: represents what this individual is relative to others •

• sex: the biological sex of the individual

• capital-gain: capital gains for an individual

• capital-loss: capital loss for an individual

• hours-per-week: the hours an individual has reported to work per week •
native-country: country of origin for an individual

• label: whether or not an individual makes more than $50,000 annually.




Your task is to use machine learning to build a machine learning (ML) models. You can apply some assumptions if necessary, but you need to explain what assumptions and why you applied in your ML model? Again, use the data science methodology to achieve the task. The following questions need to be answered.
a) Load and explore the data (note your observations).
b) Use appropriate methods to handle categorical data
c) Investigate and train at least 5 ML models including Classification (to predict if an individual going to earn more $50,000 annually or not), Clustering and Neural Networks. You are free to choose any ML algorithms.
d) Optimise your models, evaluate the models and compare the models’ results as:
i. How optimisation improve the performance of the model? Which parameter you used for optimisation.
ii. Compare the results among the models of similar types (eg. If you using two classification models, compare their performances)
e) State your overall conclusions for this task.
